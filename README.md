# The Dual-Self Systems Model: A Principled Framework for Stability-Plasticity
Current artificial intelligence systems face a fundamental dilemma: rapid adaptation to new tasks often erases foundational knowledge (catastrophic forgetting), while protecting foundation models prevents personalization and learning. This repository presents the Operational Blueprint, an architectural framework that addresses this challenge through explicit time-scale separation.The Ultimate SynthesisThis framework integrates insights from dual-process cognitive theory, predictive processing, and continual learning research into a unified computational architecture. It offers a prescriptive methodology for AI engineering that ensures:Structural Alignment: Foundational values and world knowledge are protected by freezing Self A, providing an architectural guarantee against reward hacking and gradient-based corruption.Mitigated Catastrophic Forgetting: A multi-layered defense—combining frozen backbones, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters (Self B), and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)—reduces the forgetting rate to a predicted 12%, compared to 65% in monolithic systems.Explicit Arbitration: The use of $\alpha/\beta$ routing weights transforms the stability-plasticity tradeoff from an implicit byproduct into an interpretable, controllable, and loggable design parameter.Repository ContentsManuscript_v2.pdf: The full 2025 version 2.0 manuscript detailing the theoretical foundations, mathematical formalization, and  falsifiable predictions.Dual_Self_Model.ipynb: A Google Colab-ready implementation of the Operational Blueprint demonstrating five core scenarios: System Initialization, Sequential Learning, Context-Sensitive Inference, Real-Time Monitoring, and Persistence/Recovery 8.Production_Readiness_Checklist: A definitive guide for transitioning the architecture from research to high-stakes production environments (Section 6.9).Scientific RigorThe framework remains a testable science through specific Falsification Criteria (Section 5.5). We specify conditions under which the model would be rejected, ensuring genuine accountability in its architectural claims
